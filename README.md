The file **speechLog_sentences_classification.docx** includes a legenda on how to interpret the tags in square brackets of the fourth column of the file **speechLog.csv**, which classifies Pepper and user's sentences depending on their role in the conversation (i.e., whether they are interpreted by the system as Commands, Confirmations, Proposals, Questions, etc.).
